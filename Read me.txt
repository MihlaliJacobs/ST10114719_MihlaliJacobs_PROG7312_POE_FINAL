The following project has been built to improve South African citizen engagement and service 
delivery through the implementation of a comprehensive municipal services application. 

The main functions of the application allow the users to: 
-Report issues and request services.
-Access information about local events and announcements.
-Recieve updates on the status of their service request.

In this part the focus was implementing the Events and service announcements. On this page users have 
access to upcoming and current Events which include details like Name, Date, Location, category and a description
of the events. The user will also be provided with reccomendations based on the category and date of the event 
that they selected. The user will also have access to public announcements to keep them informed with details like 
Name, Date, Category and description.
